# Knights-Tour-Solver
Developers:
Chua, Mary Elizabeth E.,
Nisay, Deiondre Judd V.

In accordance to a course project of CMSC 162: Artificial Intelligence

Implemented Depth-First Search and Warnsdorf’s Rule algorithms for finding a solution for a knight’s tour given a starting position. 


Background of Knights Tour

The knight can only move one square along one axis and travel two along the other, following an L-shaped path. The Knight's Tour problem is a classic chess problem where a knight chess piece moves around the board visiting all other squares on the board EXACTLY ONCE, starting from an arbitrary starting position.


Blind Search uses Depth-First Search method in which the code is original

Heuristic Search uses Warnsdorf's Rule which was borrowed from Jwalin Bhatt's code and was slightly changed so that the conditions of the course project can be met, such as changing the input of the user, removing some print features, and then reconstructing the order of
some of the functions.
